The main      purpose of this study is to see how their disease responds to consolidation treatment      (treatment aimed at further decreasing cancer cells) with a radioactive antibody (protein)      called iodine I 131 tositumomab (known by the tradename Bexxar®) and also to look at the side      effects which occur with this type of treatment. The investigators will also be looking at      how long disease responds to treatment, if it responds at all, and how long patients who have      had this treatment survive.      Bexxar is a monoclonal antibody (protein) to which radioactive iodine 131 is attached. The      monoclonal antibody in Bexxar (tositumomab), targets a protein called CD20 found on the      surface of a variety of B-cells, including lymphoma cells, and some myeloma cells. The      antibody is given as an infusion and finds its way to these cells. The radioactive iodine      attached to the antibody delivers radiation directly to these cells which works to harm or      kill the cancer cells. Approximately 20-25% of patients with multiple myeloma have this      protein on the surface of their tumor cells. In addition, this protein was found on the      surface of myeloma stem cells. While myeloma stem cells represent a minority of all myeloma      cells (less than 5%), these cells are resistant to chemotherapy and are believed to be      responsible for a recurrence of the disease after chemotherapy. In this study, Bexxar will be      used after patients complete a course of chemotherapy and have residual myeloma cells left in      their body. The Investigators are hoping that the treatment with Bexxar will decrease and      possibly eliminate residual myeloma cells resistant to chemotherapy.","A Phase II Clinical Trial of Consolidation Treatment With Iodine I 131 Tositumomab for Multiple Myeloma",N/A,1,NULL,16,NULL,1,"Phase 2",Closed,"Active, not recruiting","2005-08-01 00:00:00","2013-08-01 00:00:00","2023-03-01 00:00:00",Industry

There are 2 steps      to treating patients with relapsed or refractory HL. The first step is to shrink the lymphoma      with chemotherapy. The chemotherapy regimen commonly used is called ICE. ICE is a combination      of chemotherapy drugs: ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide. The second step of treatment      is to give high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy followed by infusion of stem      cells. This is called an ASCT. This study will focus on the first step of treatment for      relapsed and refractory HL.      ICE chemotherapy can cause many side effects. We believe that there are patients who can      receive less toxic treatments and still do well. We have learned from past studies that      [18F]FDG-PET scans (which we will call PET scans) can be used to predict who will do well      after ASCT. PET scans are tests used to measure the metabolic activity of the disease.      Patients without abnormal activity on their PET scan (negative PET scan) before ASCT are much      more likely to be cured than those with activity on their PET scan (positive PET scan).      In this study, instead of beginning with ICE chemotherapy, the patient will receive a new      drug called Brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35). SGN-35 is a type of drug called an antibody drug      conjugate. SGN-35 has 2 parts; a part that targets cancer cells (the antibody) and a cell      killing part (the chemotherapy). The antibody part of SGN-35 sticks to a target called CD30.      CD30 is an important molecule on some cancer cells (including Hodgkin lymphoma) and some      normal cells of the immune system. The cell killing part of SGN-35 is a chemotherapy called      monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE).      It can kill cells that the antibody part of SGN-35 sticks to.      Compared to ICE chemotherapy, SGN-has fewer side effects and does not require inpatient      admission for treatment. We aim to determine whether patients can avoid treatment with ICE      prior to ASCT. We will use the results of the PET scan to determine whether the patient needs      additional chemotherapy before ASCT. If the PET scan is negative, the patient will be      referred to ASCT and not receive ICE chemotherapy. If the PET scan is positive, the physician      will discuss further treatment options with the patient.","Brentuximab Vedotin (SGN-35) in Transplant Eligible Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma",Non-Randomized,2,NULL,46,NULL,1,"Phase 2",Closed,"Active, not recruiting","2012-01-05 00:00:00","2023-09-01 00:00:00","2023-09-01 00:00:00",Industry

Brentuximab is still being studied in clinical trials like this one to learn more about what      its side effects are and whether or not it is effective in the disease or condition being      studied.      Brentuximab Vedotin is a type of drug called an antibody drug conjugate (ADC).

They can stick to      and attack specific targets on cells. The antibody part of Brentuximab Vedotin sticks to a      target called CD30. CD30 is an important molecule on some cancer cells (including non Hodgkin      lymphoma) and some normal cells of the immune system. The cell killing part of Brentuximab      Vedotin is a chemotherapy called monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). It can kill cells that the      antibody part of Brentuximab Vedotin sticks to. Brentuximab Vedotin has also been shown to      kill cancer cells with levels of CD30 that cannot be seen by traditional methods.

Most cases of this disease in      the United States occur along the East Coast due to emigration from the Caribbean islands.      There is currently no standard treatment for ATLL. Research shows that patients who go into      first time remission (respond completely or partially to treatment) and have a bone marrow      transplant have the best outcomes. Traditional chemotherapy treatments have generally not      worked well in patients with ATLL. Additionally, not all patients will be eligible for a bone      marrow transplant.      The purpose of this study is to see how well individuals with ATLL respond to an      investigational cancer treatment. This investigational treatment combines a drug called      brentuximab vedotin with a standard chemotherapy treatment made up of cyclophosphamide,      doxorubicin, etoposide, and prednisone. This treatment is considered investigational because      it is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment      of ATLL.      Brentuximab vedotin, also known as Adcetris, is approved by the United States Food and Drug      Administration (FDA) for treatment of certain types of lymphomas, including peripheral T-cell      lymphomas when combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone in patients whose      cancer cells express a type of marker called CD30.      Brentuximab vedotin is an antibody that also has a chemotherapy drug attached to it.      Antibodies are proteins that are part of the immune system. They can stick to and attack      specific targets on cancer cells. The antibody part of brentuximab vedotin sticks to a target      called cluster of differentiation 30 (CD30) that is located on the outside of the cancer      cells. Normal cells have little or no CD30 on their surface. ATLL cancer cells often have a      larger amount of CD30 on their surface than normal cells. However, CD30 is found in different      amounts on ATLL cancer cells. This study will also test the amount of CD30 found on each      participants cancer cells. Researchers will be looking to see if the response to the study      treatment varies based on the amount of CD30 found on the outside participants cancer cells.      In another study, brentuximab vedotin was combined in another study with cyclophosphamide,      doxorubicin, and prednisone. The study included patients with various types of T-cell      lymphomas. Two of the patients enrolled in that study had ATLL. Both had a complete response      (no evidence of disease). The researchers in this study (LCCC 1637) have added etoposide to      the combination of brentuximab vedotin with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone.      They predict that the addition of etoposide will improve patient outcomes. Research shows      that etoposide helps improve outcomes in patients with certain types of T-cell lymphomas who      undergo chemotherapy treatment. This investigational combination of brentuximab vedotin with      cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, and prednisone is called BV-CHEP.","Brentuximab Vedotin With Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Etoposide, and Prednisone (BV-CHEP) for the Treatment of Adult T-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma: A Pilot Study of the Rare Lymphoma Working Group",N/A,1,"Recently updated",16,NULL,4,"Phase 2",Closed,"Active, not recruiting","2018-10-15 00:00:00","2023-12-15 00:00:00","2028-12-15 00:00:00",Industry

Giving brentuximab vedotin and      lenalidomide may work better in treating patients with T-cell lymphoma.","A Phase II Study of Brentuximab Vedotin and Lenalidomide in Relapsed and Refractory T-Cell Lymphomas",N/A,1,NULL,26,NULL,1,"Phase 2",Closed,"Active, not recruiting","2018-03-16 00:00:00","2023-04-30 00:00:00","2024-04-30 00:00:00",Non-industry

Standard rescue      treatment for these patients is chemotherapy followed by a hematopoietic stem cell auto-SCT.      Despite a very good rate of complete sustainable response in 50% of the patients, another 50%      of the patients relapse after increased therapy and require additional treatment.      Consequently, one option for these patients is to offer a novel rescue therapy, enabling them      to have partial or complete response, and offer them a hematopoietic stem cell allo-SCT. In      the only prospective phase 2 study published by Sureda et al. assessing this therapeutic      approach, the rate of mortality not linked to relapse was 8% at 100 days and 15% at 1 year.      The progression-free survival rate was 48% at 1 year and 24% at 4 years. Relapse occurred      between 3 and 35 months with a median of 6 months in 51% of the patients out of a total of 78      patients. Cumulative incidence of relapse was 37% at 1 year and 59% at 5 years.      Brentuximab Vedotin (Bv) is an anti-CD30 antibody-drug conjugate. This drug has shown its      efficacy with very acceptable toxicity in patients suffering from advanced-stage Hodgkin      lymphoma. Bv was consolidatively evaluated after an auto-SCT. 329 patients, at high risk of      relapse after auto-SCT, received Bv (n=165) in a dose of 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks or a placebo      (n=164) for 16 cycles. The progression-free survival median (validated by a panel of      independent experts) was 42.9 months (95% CI 30,4-42 ; 9) for patients in the Bv group and      24.1 months (11.5 not reached) in the placebo group.      The purpose of our study is to reduce relapse rate by carrying out maintenance with Bv after      allografting hematopoietic stem cells in a population of patients suffering from Hodgkin      lymphoma with high risk of relapse after auto-SCT. Fifty eight patients have been slated for      inclusion over a period of 2 years.      This is an open-label, prospective, multicenter, phase II trial consisting of post allo-SCT      maintenance Bv for Hodgkin lymphoma.      Patients will be recruited over 24 months and be followed for 3 years after allo-SCT.      A total of 58 patients will be included in the study. The duration of the treatment period is      approximately 10.7 months for 12 cycles of Bv.

CPX-351 is made up of daunorubicin and cytarabine and is made      in a way that makes the drugs stay in the bone marrow longer and could be less likely to      cause heart problems than traditional anthracycline drugs, a common class of chemotherapy      drug. Some acute myeloid leukemia patients have an abnormality in the structure of a gene      called FLT3. Genes are pieces of DNA (molecules that carry instructions for development,      functioning, growth and reproduction) inside each cell that tell the cell what to do and when      to grow and divide. FLT3 plays an important role in the normal making of blood cells. This      gene can have permanent changes that cause it to function abnormally by making cancer cells      grow. Gilteritinib may block the abnormal function of the FLT3 gene that makes cancer cells      grow.

Brentuximab      vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, called brentuximab, linked to a toxic agent, called      vedotin. Brentuximab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules      (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as CD30 receptors, and delivers vedotin to      kill them. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the bodys      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow      and spread. Rituximab is a type of antibody therapy, which targets and attaches to the CD20      protein found on the surface of blood cells with cancer and some healthy blood cells.      Chemotherapy drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop      the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, or by stopping them from dividing.      Prednisone is a steroid, a hormone (chemical messengers) with multiple roles, notably in the      immune system and inflammation reduction. Steroids are poisonous to lymphocytes (white blood      cells from which lymphomas develop). Giving brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab in combination      with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone may help to control the disease      and be a less harmful regimen than standard chemotherapy in patients with primary mediastinal      large B-cell lymphoma.","A Phase II Study to Determine the Response Kinetics, Safety, and Efficacy of Brentuximab Vedotin and Nivolumab Alone and Then Combined With Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, and Prednisone for Patients With Untreated Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma",N/A,1,"Recently updated",40,NULL,1,"Phase 2",Open,Recruiting,"2021-05-10 00:00:00","2025-08-03 00:00:00","2025-08-03 00:00:00",Non-industry

In both the dose escalation and dose expansion arms participants will receive subcutaneous      (SC) epcoritamab in 28-day or 21 day cycles dependent on the arm in combination with the      anti-neoplastic agents described below:      1: Oral lenalidomide in participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell      lymphoma (DLBCL); 2: Oral ibrutinib and oral lenalidomide in participants with with R/R      DLBCL; 3: Intravenous (IV) polatuzumab vedotin, IV rituximab, IV cyclophosphamide, IV      doxorubicin hydrochloride (HCl), and oral prednisone (pola-R-CHP) in participants with newly      diagnosed treatment-naïve DLBCL; 4: Oral CC-99282 in participants with R/R DLBCL; 5: Oral      CC-99282 in participants with R/R follicular lymphoma (FL); 6A: Oral ibrutinib in      participants with R/R mantle cell lymphoma (MCL); 6B: Oral ibrutinib, and oral venetoclax in      participants with R/R MCL; 7: Oral ibrutinib, and oral venetoclax in participants with newly      diagnosed treatment-naïve MCL.      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at an approved      institution (hospital or clinic). The effect of the treatment will be frequently checked by      medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires and side effects.","Phase 1b/2, Open-Label Study to Evaluate Safety and Tolerability of Epcoritamab in Combination With Anti-Neoplastic Agents in Subjects With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma",Non-Randomized,15,"Recently updated",394,NULL,63,"Phase 2",Open,Recruiting,"2022-06-14 00:00:00","2029-05-19 00:00:00","2029-05-19 00:00:00",Industry

Delivery of the 5:1 molar ratio seems to prevent antagonistic drug-drug      interactions and the liposomal encapsulation increases the plasma half-life of cytarabine and      daunorubicin and leads to drug accumulation within the bone marrow (BM).      Despite previous results that highlighted the advantage of Vyxeos for sAML, it is intuitively      likely that this powerful drug is also suitable for non-sAML. The mechanism of action is      relevant for every AML. Following the FDA approval of the drug for sAML we would like to      evaluate its efficacy for low or intermediate risk fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-negative      de novo AML patients. This consideration is particularly relevant by the inclusion of young      AML patients in the study.

One of the goals of the current study is to examine the feasibility and efficacy of the      combination of Mylotarg plus Vyxeos.      Minimal/ measurable residual disease (MRD) Minimal or measurable residual disease (MRD)      denotes the presence of leukemia cells down to levels of 1:10-4 to 1:10-6, compared with 1:20      in morphology-based assessments. MRD can be evaluated using a variety of multiparameter flow      cytometry (MFC) and molecular methods.

Purpose of this Trial The current study is designed to examine the response rate of the      Vyxeos as induction therapy for newly diagnosed low/intermediate risk AML patients in the      real world setting. Patients will receive the same induction therapy that they were to      receive had they not entered this study (cytarabine /daunorubicin ± Mylotarg) but the      combination of cytarabine /daunorubicin will be given in the unique formulation of Vyxeos.

Rituximab is a      monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of      white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer      cells. Chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide work in      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Etoposide is in a class of      medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell      division and DNA repair and may kill cancer cells. Prednisone is in a class of medications      called corticosteroids. It is used to reduce inflammation and lower the bodys immune      response to help lessen the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Giving loncastuximab tesirine      and rituximab in combination with dose-adjusted doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine,      cyclophosphamide, and prednisone may be more effective at treating high risk diffuse large      B-cell lymphoma patients than standard treatments.","A Phase 2 Study of Loncastuximab Tesirine and Rituximab (Lonca-R) Followed by DA-EPOCH-R in Previously Untreated High-Risk Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma",N/A,1,NULL,24,NULL,1,"Phase 2",Open,Recruiting,"2023-05-24 00:00:00","2026-02-01 00:00:00","2028-02-01 00:00:00",Industry

Because cathepsin L is commonly released by breast cancer      cells and aids in tumor invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. It is expected that cathepsin      L secretion by both tumor-associated macrophages and neoplastic cells would promote the      metastatic phenotype because cathepsin L is widely produced by breast cancer cells and helps      with tumor invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis.

AdCC is often charaterised by a long natural      history with a propensity for indolent but relentless growth and dissemination. Local      recurrences and late distant metastases are common findings in about 35% of the patients and      associated with a poor prognosis1. AdCC is among the most lethal salivary gland tumors2 with      no proven therapy for metastatic disease. Little is known about endogenous immune response      directed against AdCC. However, in a relatively large series of 28 AdCC tumor, the immune      profiling has shown in most tumors high and frequent programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2)      expression and PD-L1 was generally not expressed on tumor and infiltrating cells3.      The Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs) are emerging as a novel therapeutic option in cancer      treatment that looks promising for solid tumors. An experimental CD205/Ly75-directed ADC,      OBT076 induce potent cytotoxic and antitumor activity. Recently, the combination of      immunohistochemistry (IHC) and tissue micro array (TMA) was performed in a series of 46 AdCC,      showing a unique profile with both frequent and high expression of CD205/Ly75, much higher      than for other solid tumors. In a phase I study, OBT076 demonstrated promising results for 3      patients with 2 partial responses and 1 complete response for a gastric cancer4. In this last      patient, analysis showed an increase in PD1+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells suggesting that OBT076      activates the patients immune response against the tumor, especially PD-1 targeted      therapies4.      Based on this rational and on the high level of expression of CD205/Ly75 in AdCC, the      hypothesis tested in this study is that OBT076 could be a potential effective treatment for      R/M AdCC, which is an orphan lethal disease. The efficacy of OBT076 will be tested either      alone or followed by an anti PD-1 inhibitor (Balstilimab) with the hypothesis that OBT076      will induce immune infiltrate that could restore sentivity to PD-1 targeting.","A Phase Ib Study of OBT076 or OBT076 Followed by Balstilimab in Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic (R/M) Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (AdCC) of the Head and Neck (H&N)",Randomized,2,NULL,32,NULL,0,"Phase 1",Planned,"Not yet recruiting","2023-09-01 00:00:00","2026-09-01 00:00:00","2027-09-01 00:00:00",Non-industry

B-NHL is a type of cancer that develops inside or outside      of lymph nodes (glands) and organs such as the liver or spleen. Examples of B-NHL are Burkitt      Lymphoma and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma, which may be other names used to describe this      type of cancer. It is very difficult to cure relapsed or refractory B-NHL. The medicines used      now are very powerful with many side effects and only cure around 30 in every 100 children      treated. It is very important that investigators quickly find better medicines for these      children and young people.      The Glo-BNHL trial will include three groups of children and young people, each given a new      medicine (either alone or with chemotherapy). The investigators are looking to make sure the      new medicines are safe and that they work to treat the cancer. If the medicine in one group      does not work for a child in the trial, then they may be able to join a different group to      have another new medicine.      Experts from around the world will carefully pick the medicines most likely to be helpful to      be part of the trial. If one of the new medicines seems not to be working as well as hoped      then the investigators will take it out of the trial as soon as possible. This will let other      new medicines be added to the trial and tested. If a medicine does seem to be working well,      then it will continue in the trial to make sure it really is the most useful medicine      available.      Children from around the world will be invited to take part in the trial. The investigators      will then check on them for at least two years after they finish the trial treatment to look      for possible side effects of the new medicine.","A Global Study of Novel Agents in Paediatric and Adolescent Relapsed and Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma",Non-Randomized,3,"New study",210,NULL,0,"Phase 3",Planned,"Not yet recruiting","2023-10-01 00:00:00","2030-10-01 00:00:00","2032-10-01 00:00:00",Industry
